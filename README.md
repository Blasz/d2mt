# [DotA 2 Match Ticker](http://dotaprj.me)
Competitive coverage on the go!

## Contributing
This repo is based on Google Chrome extension's manifest rules. This build will not work if wrapped on a Firefox or an Opera extension. I don't know if anyone will contribute, so I won't put a how to or coding guide so in case you want to, just fork and pull and I'll merge for now!  

## API
I will release a RESTful API that fetches all the matches. For now, deal with the nodes I'm giving you.
